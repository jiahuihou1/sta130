    "# Markov Chain and Extensions: Chat Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Initial Markov Chain Code Explanation**\n",
    "- **Objective:** Track word occurrences and transitions between consecutive words using two dictionaries:\n",
    "  - `word_used`: Counts how often each word appears.\n",
    "  - `next_word`: Tracks which words follow a given word and how frequently.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Key Ideas:**\n",
    "  - A simple Markov Chain model was created to map word transitions based on a single word's occurrence.\n",
    "  - This model lacks long-term memory and only looks at the immediate word-to-word transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Comparison Between Markov Chains and GPT-4**\n",
    "- **Markov Chain:**\n",
    "  - Generates sentences by selecting the next word based on immediate probabilities from the current word.\n",
    "  - Lacks deeper understanding and context beyond immediate word-to-word relationships.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **GPT-4 (and similar models):**\n",
    "  - Uses deep learning to capture longer dependencies, understanding of context, syntax, and semantics.\n",
    "  - Far more advanced than Markov Chains, enabling better sentence generation, coherence, and logical flow.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Discussion:** \n",
    "  - A Markov chain, even with a large dataset, cannot compete with models like GPT-3/4 in terms of complexity and understanding of language.\n",
    "  - However, for simple systems with limited transitions (e.g., weather modeling), Markov Chains can be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Extensions to the Markov Chain Code**\n",
    "- **Second Code Version:**\n",
    "  - **word_used2** and **next_word2** now track pairs of words (bigrams) instead of single words.\n",
    "  - The transition probability is based on the frequency of a **third word** following a **pair of consecutive words**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "  - This is a **second-order Markov chain** model, where the prediction depends on the last two words.\n",
    "  - This allows for smoother and more context-aware transitions compared to the single-word model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## 4. **Conclusion**\n",
    "- Increasing the n-gram length (using two-word sequences) improves sentence coherence.\n",
    "- Markov Chains, though useful for some tasks, are limited compared to modern neural networks like GPT-3/4, especially in complex tasks like natural language processing.\n"

    "For question 1 and 2, the Chatbot was able to help me understand the materials with ease. It was really helpful in explaining using examples, suggestions, and from a different pov everytime I get confused. 3FOr question 3, with a lack of coding knowledge, my Chatbot was able to clearly help me write out the code. It was also written in simple python code, with comments to help me understand what exactly is happening. I am able to understand the steps of creating the program, but the chatbot was able to actually write my thoughts into context and coding format. Similar to question 1 and 2, the Chatbot was able to effectively explain the concept to me. I also had follow up questions that wouldve been hard finding out the answers to online, such as the difference between the Chatbot itself and Markovian ChatBot we just discussed about. Of course, same for question 5, it was able to discuss the points to me clearly. \n",
    "### 2. \n",
    "Yes, working with a Chatbot could definitely be frustrating. I first used the Chatbot on the free version, and it was unable to follow the instructions given for qeustion 5, part 3. Without extra information it struggles with following lenient guidelines, but I feel like once I get better at instruction structuring, it will all get better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. \n",
    "ChatGPT was extremely good at troubleshooting coding errors. Maybe its because I have the premium version now, that I found it to be very helpful in explaning and helping me understand the code in its entirety. Its able to break down the code into simpler terms, give an explanation suitable for someone with no previous coding understanding, and such. Overall, I feel like my Chatbot experience has been greatly benificial to my learning. \n"

    "in my conversation with the chatbot, I realized that to pursue a career in data, especially in statistics and quantitative finance, both of which im interesting in pursuing, I'll require a mix of key skills, some of the hard skills include math, and stats, such as working with probability and predictive modeling. I will also need to be good at coding to handle analyze such data, but with the speed of AI advancement, I feel like I will only require a basic understanding in the future as I could do much above my skill level with an AI assistant. Some soft skills include being able to communicate my understandings and finding clearly, especially in quantitative finance, is something I'll need to focus on.  "
