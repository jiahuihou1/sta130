    "## Research Question 1: How do various aspects of social interaction impact self-reported mental health and well-being?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "- **Row 93**: **Frequency of social interactions** - Number of weekly social contacts, measured across different types (e.g., friends, family, coworkers).\n",
    "- **Row 55**: **Quality of social interactions** - Rating of satisfaction with social connections, which can provide context beyond just frequency.\n",
    "- **Row 101-104**: **Type of social connections** - Categories including family, friends, neighbors, and workplace connections, each of which could have distinct impacts.\n",
    "- **Row 97-100**: **Duration of social interactions** - Average time spent in social interactions per week, considering both in-person and virtual forms.\n",
    "- **Row 543**: **Mental health score** - Self-reported mental health on a scale (e.g., 1-10), reflecting general well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested Visualizations\n",
    "- **Scatter plot with trend line**: To show the relationship between interaction frequency and mental health scores.\n",
    "- **Box plots**: Compare mental health scores across types of social connections (family vs. friends).\n",
    "- **Heatmap**: To illustrate correlations between multiple social factors (e.g., quality, frequency) and mental health indicators like loneliness and well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Method\n",
    "- **Multiple Linear Regression**: To model how interaction frequency, quality, and type of connections jointly influence mental health scores. This approach accounts for interactions between variables and provides a comprehensive view of different social factors' effects.\n",
    "  - **Assumptions**: Normality of residuals (checked with Q-Q plots), no multicollinearity among predictors (checked with Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for each variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "Higher frequency and quality of interactions are expected to correlate positively with mental health, while increased loneliness inversely affects mental health. Different connection types (e.g., family vs. friends) might have varying levels of impact. This analysis could guide targeted social support initiatives, emphasizing quality interactions or specific types of social connections as important for mental well-being.\n",

    "## Research Question 2: Does community engagement influence individuals' sense of belonging, and how does demographic identity affect this relationship?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "- **Row 902**: **Community engagement level** - Categories reflecting frequency of participation in community events, volunteer work, or social activities.\n",
    "- **Rows 1389, 1419**: **Sense of belonging** - Self-reported score on belonging within one's community.\n",
    "- **Demographic characteristics**: Age, gender identity, relationship status, and veteran/indigenous status, which could moderate the impact of community engagement on belonging.\n",
    "- **Rows 36-43**: **COVID-19 prevention behaviors** - Degree of adherence to COVID-related distancing and mask-wearing, as these behaviors might impact levels of social connection and community involvement.\n",
    "- **Row 27**: **Social identity factors** - Inclusion in LGBTQ+, BIPOC, or mental health communities, as these may offer insight into how community engagement and sense of belonging vary across identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested Visualizations\n",
    "- **Box plot**: To show belonging scores across different levels of community engagement, segmented by demographic factors.\n",
    "- **Stacked bar chart**: Visualize proportions of high vs. low belonging by various social identity groups.\n",
    "- **Heatmap**: Show correlations between COVID-19 preventive behaviors and belonging across different engagement levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Method\n",
    "- **ANOVA with Interaction Terms**: Used to compare the sense of belonging across groups with differing levels of community engagement, while considering the influence of demographic variables (age, gender, social identity). Interaction terms reveal if the effect of community engagement on belonging differs across demographic groups, such as gender or social identity (e.g., LGBTQ and Indigenous identities).\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Assumptions**: Normality of belonging scores across groups and homogeneity of variance within each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "Higher community engagement is hypothesized to correlate positively with a stronger sense of belonging, though the strength of this relationship may vary by demographic identity.\n",

    "## Research Question 3: How does family support relate to overall life satisfaction and subjective well-being?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "- **Row 1754**: **Family Support Level** - Categories reflecting the frequency of group exercise or family-based activities as a proxy for family or group involvement.\n",
    "- **Row 1497**: **Life Satisfaction** - Self-reported life satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 10, providing a direct measure of contentment with life.\n",
    "- **Row 1851**: **Emotional Health Indicators** - Frequency of feelings of depression or hopelessness over the past two weeks, offering insight into mental health status, which could be influenced by family support.\n",
    "- **Rows 2106-2113**: **Subjective Well-Being** - Agreement level with statements on interest and engagement in daily tasks, reflecting subjective well-being and engagement in life.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested Visualizations\n",
    "- **Box plots**: Display life satisfaction scores across levels of family/group exercise engagement to capture variations in satisfaction based on family involvement.\n",
    "- **Scatter plot**: Correlate life satisfaction with emotional health indicators, showing trends between family support, well-being, and satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Method\n",
    "- **Correlation Analysis**: To assess the relationship between family support levels (measured indirectly via group engagement) and life satisfaction.\n",
    "- **Linear Regression**: Use life satisfaction as a dependent variable, with family support (group engagement) and emotional health indicators as independent variables, to identify significant predictors of life satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "Higher family support is expected to correlate positively with life satisfaction and reduced feelings of depression. Positive family involvement is predicted to improve subjective well-being and satisfaction.\n",
